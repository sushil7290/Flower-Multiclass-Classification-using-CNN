# Flower-Multiclass-Classification-using-CNN
This project focuses on building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of flowers into multiple categories. Post training, the model aims to accurately identify different species of flowers from a diverse dataset. Applications of project include enhancing image search engines with flower recognition capabilities.
